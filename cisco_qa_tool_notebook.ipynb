Page 1 of 8  Data Sheet  \\nCisco Cloud Services Router 1000V \\nCisco IOS XE Software Release 3.11 \\n \\nThe Cisco ® Cloud Services Router 1000V (CSR 1000V) is a single-te nant router in \\nvirtual form-factor that delivers comprehensive WAN gat eway functions to multitenant \\nprovider-hosted clouds. Using familiar, industry-leading  Cisco IOS ® Software \\nnetworking capabilities, the CSR 1000V enables enterpri ses to extend their WANs \\ntransparently into external provider-hosted clouds and cloud providers to offer their \\ntenants enterprise-class networking services. \\nBusinesses, small and large, are increasingly virtu alizing their data center infrastructures and appli cations, to save \\ncosts and become more agile. Many enterprises have started deploying IT applications in virtualized da ta centers \\nthat are built and managed by third-party service p roviders. These external data centers, known as pro vider-\\nhosted clouds, allow enterprises to gain infrastruc ture and resources on demand and become even more \\noperationally efficient. \\nHowever, the shared-infrastructure, shared-resource  cloud environment poses networking and security pr oblems \\nto enterprises. First, an enterprise does not have ownership of its cloud connectivity, so cannot exte nd its network \\nconfiguration into the cloud. Next, it does not enj oy the same levels of privacy and security for its cloud \\ndeployment as it does on its premises. Third, it ca nnot directly connect its distributed sites to its cloud applications \\n- instead having to backhaul all network traffic th rough its data center - because it lacks a network- aware endpoint \\nin the cloud. The cloud also presents networking ch allenges to cloud providers. The primary concern is  the scale \\nlimitations of the current network switching archit ecture. The cloud provider also lacks all the compo nents of an \\nend-to-end managed connectivity service offering to  its customers, including quality of service (QoS),  application \\nvisibility, and service-level agreements (SLAs). \\nThe Cisco CSR 1000V addresses these cloud-based net working and security constraints. Built on the same  \\nproven Cisco IOS Software platform that is inside t he Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR) and Aggre gation \\nServices Router (ASR) product families, it offers a  rich set of features, including routing, VPN, fire wall, Network \\nAddress Translation (NAT), QoS, application visibil ity, failover, and WAN optimization. These function s empower \\nenterprises and cloud providers to build highly sec ure, optimized, scalable, and consistent hybrid net works.

Page 2 of 8  Product Overview and Benefits \\nThe Cisco CSR 1000V is a software router that an en terprise or a cloud provider can deploy as a virtua l machine \\n(VM) in a provider-hosted cloud. It can run on Cisc o Unified Computing System ™ (Cisco UCS ®) servers; on \\nservers from leading vendors that support VMware ES Xi, Citrix XenServer, or Red Hat KVM virtualization ; or on \\nthe Amazon EC2 cloud. It contains Cisco IOS Softwar e networking and security features. \\nA typical cloud provides IT infrastructure and reso urces to multiple customers or tenants. The Cisco C SR 1000V \\nserves primarily as a router per tenant (Figure 1).  That is, each tenant gets its own routing instance , hence its own \\nVPN connections, firewall policies, QoS rules, acce ss control, and so on. \\nFigure 1.   Cisco CSR 1000V - Positioned as a Single-Tenant WAN  Gateway in a Multitenant Cloud Internet \\n \\nFollowing is how you could use the Cisco CSR 1000V in a cloud: \\n● Secure VPN gateway:  The CSR 1000V offers route-based IP Security (IPse c) VPNs (Dynamic Multipoint \\nVPN [DMVPN], EasyVPN, and FlexVPN), and in the futu re, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN, along with \\nthe Cisco IOS Zone-Based Firewall and access contro l, enabling an enterprise to connect distributed si tes \\ndirectly to its cloud deployment (Table 1).

An enterprise can directly and dynamically \\nconnect its distributed sites to its cloud deployment - \\navoiding the latency caused by the typical backhaul \\nthrough the data center while overcoming the \\nmanagement complexity of point-to-point IPsec VPNs. \\n● Consistent WAN architecture: The Cisco IOS Software-\\nbased CSR 1000V complements the widely deployed \\nCisco ISRs and ASRs. Enterprises can now deploy a \\nCisco endpoint at every node in their network, allowin g \\nfor consistent network configuration and security \\npolicies across their distributed hybrid networks. \\n● MPLS WAN endpoint:  The CSR 1000V can serve as an MPLS router that ena bles a service provider to \\noffer end-to-end managed connectivity (customer sit e-to-customer cloud deployment) with performance \\nguarantees. Also, by extending the Multiprotocol La bel Switching (MPLS) WAN deeper into the cloud \\nnetwork, the service provider can increase network scale - more tenants and more networks per tenant \\n(Table 2). \\nTable 2. Cisco CSR 1000V as an MPLS WAN Endpoint \\nCustomer Problem Features Benefits of CSR 1000V \\n● A service provider needs to extend \\nMPLS connectivity to its customers’ \\ncloud segments: Service providers \\nthat offer managed connectivity \\nservice to businesses want to help \\ntheir customers connect with off-\\npremises clouds. In order to provide \\nend-to-end connectivity, the service \\nproviders want to extend their private \\nMPLS WANs into the clouds right up \\nto the edge of the customers’ \\nsegments within the clouds. ● MPLS VPN \\n● Virtual Route Forwarding (VRF) \\n● BGP \\n● Generic routing encapsulation (GRE) \\n● QoS \\n● IP SLA ● MPLS extension within a cloud: A service provider can \\nmanage the cloud connectivity of its customers and \\noffer performance and reliability guarantees with the  \\nhelp of a dedicated CSR 1000V (serving as a customer \\nedge [CE] router) per customer. \\n● Intracloud scale: A typical cloud network is highly \\nswitched - a router hands off incoming traffic to a grou p \\nof switches, which assign the traffic to customer \\nVLANs. In this network architecture, the cloud provider \\ncannot scale beyond 4096 VLANs per router, limiting \\nthe number of customers it can support. The CSR \\n1000V, serving as a customer edge or provider edge \\n(PE) extension, can help overcome these scale \\nlimitations by creating routing overlays within the clo ud, \\nminimizing the providers’ dependence on VLANs. \\n● Layer 2 (virtual-machine migration) or Layer 3 Exte nsion (IP Mobility) from premises to cloud:  The \\nCSR 1000V offers features such as NAT and Cisco Loc ator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) that can enable \\nan enterprise to maintain addressing consistency ac ross premises and cloud as it moves applications ba ck \\nand forth or bursts compute capacity into the cloud . The Cisco CSR 1000V Overlay Transport Virtualizat ion \\n(OTV) and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) featur es enable an enterprise to extend VLAN segments \\nfrom its data center into the cloud for server back up, disaster recovery, and compute scale (Table 3).

Page 1 of 8  Data Sheet  \\nCisco Cloud Services Router 1000V \\nCisco IOS XE Software Release 3.11 \\n \\nThe Cisco ® Cloud Services Router 1000V (CSR 1000V) is a single-te nant router in \\nvirtual form-factor that delivers comprehensive WAN gat eway functions to multitenant \\nprovider-hosted clouds. Using familiar, industry-leading  Cisco IOS ® Software \\nnetworking capabilities, the CSR 1000V enables enterpri ses to extend their WANs \\ntransparently into external provider-hosted clouds and cloud providers to offer their \\ntenants enterprise-class networking services. \\nBusinesses, small and large, are increasingly virtu alizing their data center infrastructures and appli cations, to save \\ncosts and become more agile. Many enterprises have started deploying IT applications in virtualized da ta centers \\nthat are built and managed by third-party service p roviders. These external data centers, known as pro vider-\\nhosted clouds, allow enterprises to gain infrastruc ture and resources on demand and become even more \\noperationally efficient. \\nHowever, the shared-infrastructure, shared-resource  cloud environment poses networking and security pr oblems \\nto enterprises. First, an enterprise does not have ownership of its cloud connectivity, so cannot exte nd its network \\nconfiguration into the cloud. Next, it does not enj oy the same levels of privacy and security for its cloud \\ndeployment as it does on its premises. Third, it ca nnot directly connect its distributed sites to its cloud applications \\n- instead having to backhaul all network traffic th rough its data center - because it lacks a network- aware endpoint \\nin the cloud. The cloud also presents networking ch allenges to cloud providers. The primary concern is  the scale \\nlimitations of the current network switching archit ecture. The cloud provider also lacks all the compo nents of an \\nend-to-end managed connectivity service offering to  its customers, including quality of service (QoS),  application \\nvisibility, and service-level agreements (SLAs). \\nThe Cisco CSR 1000V addresses these cloud-based net working and security constraints. Built on the same  \\nproven Cisco IOS Software platform that is inside t he Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR) and Aggre gation \\nServices Router (ASR) product families, it offers a  rich set of features, including routing, VPN, fire wall, Network \\nAddress Translation (NAT), QoS, application visibil ity, failover, and WAN optimization. These function s empower \\nenterprises and cloud providers to build highly sec ure, optimized, scalable, and consistent hybrid net works.
